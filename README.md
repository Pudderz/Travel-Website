##### Issues
Tired different options but didnt want to spend money on the google api. I then tried google my maps and atlist maps. However i found that they came with a watermarks of their company and were not very interactive. I then came across leafletJs which solved all my problems and i was able to interact with the map as it wa not a iframe and did not come with a large watermark.
